# omsz_salary_calculator
The goal of this project is to develop a webApp that is capable of calculating the salary of employees of the OMSZ (National Ambulance Service in Hungary). The WebApp takes the specific work shifts of the employees as an input, and uses a calendar, the holidays and the current laws to run the calculations.
